                <header>Solomon's Keychain v1.1-snapshot - Documentation</header>

                <p>Thank you for checking out <a href="https://github.com/kaimitai/skchain/">Solomon's Keychain</a>. With this tool you will be able to alter the level data and game metadata for Solomon's Key (NES). We support altering the US, EU and JP versions of the game. The application also supports expanding the ROM to vastly increase data size.</p>

                <p>Check out the various sections of this document for an explanation of the program's functionality.</p>

                <p>In order to use the level editor efficiently, it is recommended to read the documentation.</p>

            </section>

            <hr>

            <section class="main-section" id="basics">

                <header>Basics</header>

                <p>When starting the editor, the application will look for NES-files in the application directory, and load any if found.</p>

                <p>The application can also be started from the command-line with path to a NES-file as parameter. This means you can drag and drop a ROM file on the application to immediately load the file, at least on Windows.</p>

                <p>When the editor starts successfully, it will tell you which NES-ROM file is loaded, which region the ROM belongs to, and which directory it uses as the working directory.</p>

                <p>If the US-version of the ROM was loaded, it can be expanded to overcome data size limits.</p>

                <p>There are three element types in the editor: Items, Monsters and Metadata. You can select elements from the element picker, and right-click on the gameboard to insert them. Metadata elements are blocks, constellation background, key position, door position, player start position and so on. The item elements are game items, which can be hidden or inside breakable blocks. The third type, enemies, represents game enemies and other sprites; fairies and Mighty Bomb Jack.</p>

                <p>Your work can be stored as a NES-ROM, IPS patch or xml-files. We recommend using xml-files during development, and IPS when distributing your patch. xml-files have no space-limitations like the ROM-files, and they are easier to use in version control systems like git, since they are text files.</p>

                <p>When saving your work as a NES-file or an IPS-file, the editor checks if you exceed the space limits imposed by the game. Check the output section of the Main Window to see if your file was saved successfully, or if a data section was too big. When a data section is too big, you need to delete elements (items, enemies) from the section to save NES or IPS-files.</p>

            </section>

            <hr>

            <section class="main-section" id="configuration">

                <header>Configuration</header>

                <p>When opening the editor, the program looks for a file skc_config.xml in the same directory as the executable, or in the folder from which the NES-ROM was loaded. This is a configuration XML which lets you configure the editor's graphics and layouts, ROM-data offsets and so on.</p>

                <p>The default configuration xml which ships with the editor should be fine for most users, but we explain the configuration format for advanced modders in a separate section.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Save xml</b> button: Saves your work as a group of xmls, stored under a subfolder ./xml of the loaded ROM-file. This is the recommended file format to use for development.</li>
                    <li><b>Save IPS</b> button: Saves your work as an IPS-patch, which is the difference between your work and the initially loaded NES-file. This is the recommended format for patch distribution, as long as the base ROM loaded is the "official" version.</li>
                    <li><b>Save NES</b> button: Saves your work as an NES-file. This is the recommended format when testing your levels. If you loaded "SK.nes", the output filename will be "SK-out.nes" to avoid overwriting your base ROM which was loaded. If you want to overwrite the file instead, hold Shift when saving.</li>
                    <li><b>Expand ROM</b> button: Only available when the base US-version of the ROM is loaded. This button will increase the ROM-size, which removes a lot of restrictions. Each demon mirror will get its own drop schedule and enemy set (enemy sets can contain up to 7 enemies), the output ROMs will not have any item data restrictions, and 15 enemies can be added to each level.</li>
                    <li><b>Load xml</b> button: Will load xml-files from the xml-subfolder, if they exist. If the metadata xml indicates that it comes from an expanded ROM (by checking if there are 53x2 demon mirror drop schedules), the ROM will be expanded automatically if the currently loaded ROM is the base US-version</li>
                    <li><b>Drop Schedules</b> button: Will open/close the Demon Mirror Drop Schedules-window. Button is yellow when the window is active. See separate section.</li>
                    <li><b>Enemy Sets</b> button: Will open/close the Demon Mirror Enemy Sets-window. Button is yellow when the window is active. See separate section.</li>
                    <li><b>Level</b>-slider. Use to select which level to edit.</li>
                    <li>Finally a section for output messages follow.</li>

                <header>Level Editing</header>

                <img src="./images/subwin02_elements.png" alt="Element Picker" />

                <p>The Element Picker lets you pick items to place in the level. There are three element modes; metadata, items and enemies. The current mode will be highlighted. To place the selected element in the level, simply right click at the Levels-window to insert it at any given location.</p>

                <p>The layout, tooltip descriptions and icon graphics of the element picker can be altered in the configuration xml.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Meta</b> button: Enter metadata editing mode</li>
                    <li><b>Items</b> button: Enter items editing mode</li>
                    <li><b>Enemies</b> button: Enter enemies editing mode</li>

                <hr>
                <img src="./images/subwin03_level.png" alt="Tiles sub-window" />

                <p>
                    The level window is where level editing takes place. You can click any element on the board (apart from blocks and constellation graphics), move it around and change its properties. You can also insert new elements from the element picker.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Right Click</b>: Will insert the selected element picker element at the location, unless one exists there already. If you want to place more than one enemy at the same location - make one in a free location and move it.</li>
                    <li><b>Left Click</b>: Select item on the gameboard. Will change element mode to the type of the selected element. (if you are in items editing mode and click on a metadata item, the editing mode will change to metadata) The selected element will be outlined by a pulsating yellow square</li>
                    <li><b>Shift + Left Click</b>: Move the selected element to the clicked location</li>
                    <li><b>Delete</b> keyboard button: Delete selected board element. (if this element is a door or a key, it will be hidden instead - and other metadata items cannot be deleted)</li>
                    <li><b>1,2,3</b> keyboard buttons: When held, will draw empty tiles, brown blocks and white blocks under the mouse cursor, respectively</li>
                    <li><b>Tab</b> keyboard button: Will cycle between items of the same type. Hold shift to browse backward.
                    <li><b>Escape</b> keyboard button: Toggles foreground rendering on/off</li>
                    <li><b>G</b> keyboard button: Toggle gridlines</li>
                    <li><b>Ctrl+S</b> keyboard buttons: Save NES-file. Hold Shift to overwrite the input file</li>
                    <li><b>Up</b> keyboard button: Go to next level</li>
                    <li><b>Down</b> keyboard button: Go to previous level</li>
                    <li><b>Home</b> keyboard button: Go to first level</li>
                    <li><b>End</b> keyboard button: Go to last level</li>
                    <li><b>Mousewheel Up/Down:</b> Scroll between levels, as long as no window is hovered</li>
                    <li><b>Tileset</b> slider: Will set the level's tileset, out of 3 possible tilesets.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Decrease Rate</b> slider: Increase to make the level's time decrease faster in the game</li>
                    <li><b>Demonhead/Saramandor Lifetime</b> slider: Determines how long the spawned enemies will live before despawning. The higher the number, the longer they live</li>
                    <li><b>Remove constellation</b> button: Removes constellation from the level, if it has one</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <p>The Selected Element-window will allow altering all properties of the selected element. This window will look different depending on which type of element is selected.</p>

                <img src="./images/subwin04_01_selected_element_meta.png" alt="Selected Element: Metadata" />

                <p>If we are in metadata mode and select a Demon Mirror on the board, the properties will look like this.</p>

                <p>All elements have position-sliders, which lets you change its position. (an alternative to Shift+Click) For Demon Mirrors, you can also set the drop schedule and enemy set. For expanded ROMs this should not be necessary, as each mirror has its own schedule and enemy set.</p>

                <p>You can also edit the data of the drop schedule and enemy set used by the selected mirror. This is an alternative to the separate windows for editing this data. If you are editing a "vanilla" ROM, one that has not been expanded, note that several mirrors share the same drop schedules and enemy sets.</p>

                <p>For the key position, you can also set properties "hidden" and "in block".</p>

                <p>The "hide"-button will move the metadata element to position (0, -1).</p>

                <img src="./images/subwin04_02_selected_element_item.png" alt="Selected Element: Items" width="400" />

                <p>For element type Item, the properties are positions, as well as making the item hidden or stored in a block. In addition there is a delete-button, which is an alternative to keyboard button Delete</p>

                <p>The "code"-slider will let you cycle through item codes at will.</p>

                <img src="./images/subwin04_03_selected_element_enemy.png" alt="Selected Element: Items" width="400" />

                <p>For element type Enemy, the properties are positions, as well as speed and direction, depending on the enemy.</p>

                <p>The "code"-slider will let you cycle through enemy codes at will.</p>

                <hr>

                <img src="./images/subwin05_mirror_enemy_sets.png" alt="Demon Mirror Enemy Sets" width="400" />
                <p>The Mirror Enemy Sets-window will let you change and rearrange the enemy sets which can be used by Demon Mirrors. Each set consists of one or more enemies, and these will be cycled through as they are dropped by a demon mirror spawn point. (Technically an enemy set can be empty, but if any demon mirror uses such an enemy set, the game will crash)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enemy Set</b> slider: Select enemy set to edit</li>
                    <li><b>Enemy</b> graphical button: Select a character in the current enemy set. Selected character will have a yellow background</li>
                    <li><b>Direction/Speed</b> slider: Set properties for selected enemy</li>
                    <li><b>Move Left/Right</b> buttons: Move selected enemy to the left or the right in the cycle</li>
                    <li><b>Delete</b> button: Remove selected enemy</li>
                    <li><b>Add from Element Picker</b> button: Insert selected enemy from the Element Picker into the current Enemy Set</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="./images/subwin06_mirror_enemy_schedules.png" alt="Demon Mirror Drop Schedules Sets" width="400" />
                <p>The Mirror Drop Schedules-window will let you change the enemy drop schedules which can be used by Demon Mirrors. Each set consists of an intial schedule, and a looping schedule. When the level starts, the initial set is played through once - and then the looping section is repeatedly cycled through.</p>

                <p>A selected checkbox means an enemy will drop at that time. The game time between each checkbox seems to be a little lower than 100.</p>

                <header>XML formats</header>

                <p>When the levelset is saved as xml, 54 xml-files are created in a sufolder <b>xml</b> of the loaded NES-file: 53 files for the levels, and one for the metadata.</p>

                <p>The xml for metadata configuration is called levels-metadata.xml, and has the following tags:</p>

                <header>Notes on expanding the ROM</header>

                <p>When loading a base US-version of the ROM, the editor gives you the option of expanding the ROM. When the ROM is expanded, the data section sizes are greatly increased. Each Demon Mirror gets its own drop schedule and enemy set (with up to 7 enemies in each), the levels can have arbitrarily many items, and each level can have up to 15 enemies.</p>

                <p>When converting a base ROM to an expanded ROM, a patch is applied. This patch changes the mapper from number 3 to 66, and alters some gamecode to read data from other locations. There are some fundamental differences in the way the data is stored in an original ROM versus an expanded ROM. An overview of the expanded ROM data layout follows.</p>

                <p>The level data starts at offset 0xc010, and comes in 53 contiguous blocks of 256 bytes - one block per level. The following table describes the layout of such a block:</p>

                <p>After the 53 256-byte blocks, we arrive at ROM offset 0xf510. From here, 106 8-byte blocks follow. These are the drop schedules for mirror #1 and #2 alternating, from level 1 to 53.</p>

                <p>On average, you will have much more to work with when the ROM is expanded, compared to a vanilla hack. There are some cons though:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Expanded ROMs can have 15 enemies per level, vanilla ROMs can have up to 16</li>
                    <li>Expanded ROMs can have 7 enemies per demon mirror enemy set, vanilla ROMs can have up to 25 (or 41 if we turn all 17 sets into one)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Most of the behavior of the editor is defined in skc_config.xml. If you want to alter this file, make sure you keep a backup, as the application requires this file to start.
